### Enabling trace logging
For some terminal issues it's useful to get trace logs, this can reveal at what point something is failing. Follow these steps to get the logs:
1. Close all VS Code windows
2. Launch VS Code from the terminal using `code --log trace`
3. At this point you should reproduce the termnial issue you're having
4. Run the command "Developer: Open Log File..." (F1 opened command palette) to get an editor containing the logs

### Enabling escape sequence logging
This was added in v1.26.
For issues where text is misbehaving in the terminal you can enable logging of the data being sent to the emulator from the shell process. To enable escape sequence logging run the "Terminal: Toggle Escape Sequence Logging" command from the command palette (F1), the logs can then be viewed in the devtools console (Help &gt; Toggle Developer Tools).
